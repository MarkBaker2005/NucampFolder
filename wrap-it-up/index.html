        <h1>Wrap it Up</h1>
        <p>
          What we offer is simple. What we deliver is not. Pay $5. That's it,
          and every week, we will make a Wrap that intrigues and delights. Or
          maybe it doesn't? Who gives a shit, all you paid is $5. We will do our
          best to make it taste amazing...but if you don't like it? Fuck off it
          only cost $5. Can you make requests for what goes in the wrap? No you
          can't, requests can fuck right off too. We will always pledge to do
          our best to make a wrap that WE would LOVE to eat, but as for whether
          or not you would love to eat it, who knows. Our best guess though is
          that if you don't like it, you probably just have bad taste, or no
          taste at all...Either way our answer is, it cost $5, fuck off, we did
          our best. We can offer it for $5 because we don't give you the choice,
          we make it in bulk and we make it amazing. If you didn't like it, fuck
          off!! When it comes to food, let's get real, we aren't great at
          deciding. How many couples have argued over what to get to eat night
          after night. Fuck off. That's boring shit right there, just let us
          decide for you. If you don't like it, at least you are still alive and
          didn't just settle on "Chinese food". We live in a world where the
          customer is always right, where we aim to please. What if the customer
          didn't know what was best, because they rarely do? What if the
          customer just shut the fuck up and appreciated what was given to them.
          That's what we aim for at Wrap it up. Shut the fuck up, let us do the
          work, and if you don't like it bitch about it to someone else. Cause
          we don't give a shit. And we love you.
